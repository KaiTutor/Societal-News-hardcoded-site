      <br>
      The U.S. dollar's dominance as a reserve currency, holding about 58% of global foreign exchange reserves, is underpinned by its liquidity, the robustness of U.S. markets, and the petrodollar arrangement, where oil trades are predominantly settled in dollars. 
      <br><br>
      This system, formalized in the 1970s through U.S.-Saudi agreements, ensures sustained demand for dollars by linking them to global energy markets. 
      <br><br>
      However, the 2022 freezing of approximately $300 billion in Russian assets by the U.S. and allies has amplified concerns over the dollar's vulnerability to political exploitation, prompting diversification away from it.
      <br><br>
      Recent developments, like the U.S. military operation in Venezuela leading to Maduro's capture, underscore how these financial tactics intersect with resource geopolitics.
      <br><br>
      Venezuela, possessing the world's largest proven oil reserves, has long challenged the petrodollar by attempting to trade oil in alternative currencies and cryptocurrencies. 
      <br><br>
      <strong>Catalyst for De-Dollarization</strong>
      <br><br>
      In response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations immobilized Russian reserves held abroad, a move that prevented access without constituting outright confiscation. 
      <br><br>
      By 2025, proposals to utilize interest from these assets for Ukrainian aid had materialized, intensifying perceptions of financial theft among non-aligned states. 
      <br><br>
      This action signaled that sovereign assets could be leveraged as geopolitical tools, eroding trust in the dollar system.
      <br><br>
      Nations like China, India, and Russia responded by accelerating bilateral trade in local currencies. For instance, China-Russia trade reached 90% non-dollar settlements by 2025, while India utilized rupee-ruble mechanisms for Russian oil imports. 
      <br><br>
      BRICS summits emphasized alternative payment systems, viewing the freeze as evidence that non-compliance with Western policies could result in asset expropriation. 
      <br><br>
      Empirically, the dollar's reserve share dipped from 60% in 2021 to 58% by late 2025, with increased gold and renminbi(China’s Yen) holdings reflecting diversification strategies.

      <br>
      <strong>Oil Hegemony</strong>
      <br><br>
      The petrodollar system relies on oil-exporting nations recycling surpluses into dollar-denominated assets, sustaining global demand for the currency. 
      <br><br>
      Challenges to this, such as OPEC's occasional euro-pricing discussions or Russia's non-dollar oil deals, threaten U.S. economic leverage. 
      <br><br>
      The Russian asset freeze amplified these risks by demonstrating the dollar's weaponization, prompting oil-rich nations to seek alternatives and thereby debasing the dollar's appeal.
      <br><br>
      Venezuela's policies under Maduro exemplified this threat. Since 2017, Caracas has pursued oil sales in euros, yuan, and the petro cryptocurrency to circumvent U.S. sanctions, directly undermining petrodollar exclusivity. 
      <br><br>
      Alliances with Russia and China further facilitated non-dollar transactions, aligning with broader de-dollarization post the Russian freeze. 
      <br><br>
      Scholars argue that such moves represent an existential challenge to U.S. financial dominance, as they erode the implicit guarantee of dollar stability tied to oil markets.

      <strong>U.S. Intervention in Venezuela</strong>
      <br><br>
      The January 3, 2026, U.S. operation capturing Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas marks a direct escalation, framed officially as enforcement against drug trafficking but intertwined with oil geopolitics. 
      <br><br>
      President Trump explicitly linked the action to assuming control of Venezuela's oil, inviting U.S. companies to invest in its infrastructure. This intervention can be seen as a response to the debasement pressures initiated by the Russian asset freeze, which accelerated global shifts away from the dollar.
      <br><br>
      By securing Venezuela's reserves, estimated at 300 billion barrels or $17 Trillion usd, the U.S. aims to reinforce the petrodollar by ensuring oil flows remain dollar-denominated, countering de-dollarization trends. 
      <br><br>
      Maduro's regime, through its resistance to U.S. sanctions and non-dollar oil sales, exemplified the risks posed by such diversification, making it a target amid heightened fears post-Russia. 
      <br><br>
      Analyses suggest this capture revives petrodollar debates, as controlling Venezuelan oil could recycle petrodollars into U.S. assets, stabilizing reserve demand.
      <br><br>
      The 2022 Russian asset freeze has debased the dollar by fostering de-dollarization, creating a feedback loop that incentivizes U.S. actions like the 2026 Maduro capture to control Venezuelan oil and sustain the petrodollar.
