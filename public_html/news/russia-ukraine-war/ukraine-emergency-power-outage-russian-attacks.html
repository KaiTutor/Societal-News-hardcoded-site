      One person was killed and four others were injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a mass attack on the capital overnight Jan. 24, officials said.
      <br><br>
      Explosions were first heard at 1:20 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground, who continued to report blasts throughout the night, including the interception of a ballistic missile.
      <br><br>
      The Ukrainian Air Force tallied 396 aerial weapons, including 21 missiles and 375 drones. The Air Force mentioned hypersonic "Tsirkon" missiles, ballistic Iskander missiles and Kh-22/Kh-32 cruise missiles.
      <br><br>
      The attacks continued Russia's targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which has resulted in an ongoing winter energy crisis following similar mass attacks the nights of Jan. 9 and Jan. 20.
      <br><br>
      OSINT Telegram Channel MonitoringWar illustrated the most recent attack's focal points, which also included substantial strikes on the cities of Kharkiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhya, nearer to occupied territories. Kyiv was, however, the focal point, as it has been throughout January.
      <br><br>
      <img src="/assets/images/russian-strikes-map.jpeg" alt="Jan24 map of russian strikes on ukraine" class="content-image" style="max-with: 480px; max-height: 480px; margin: 0 auto; box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), 0px 6px 20px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);"> 
      <br><br>
      Vitaliy Zaichenko, CEO of UkrEnergo, the state grid operator, told the Kyiv Independent that Kyiv's "left bank", the part of the city on the east side of the Dnipro River , faces a dire situation when it comes to heating, which is extending further into the right bank. 80% of Ukraine will face emergency unscheduled power outages on Jan. 24.
      <br><br>
      Kyiv's municipal government announced cuts to service to a stretch of the metro line that crosses the Dnipro from the right-bank neighborhood of Pechersk to Darnytsia on the left bank, citing "damage to the fencing." Other lines remain unaffected.
      <br><br>
      In the Holosiivsky neighborhood, a Shahed drone hit a "Roshen" factory, a candy company owned by former President Petro Poroshenko. Kyiv's emergency services reported that one person died in the strike, while another three were injured.
      <br><br>
      Despite the strike and morning death, the Roshen's was open again shortly after 11. Hennadiy, one of its frequent patrons, inadvertently came upon the scene en route to his morning coffee.
      <br><br>
      "I live maybe half a kilometer away," the 50-year-old Hennadiy, who declined to give his last name, told the Kyiv Independent, coffee in hand. "(The strike) was mighty loud, but nobody knew exactly where it came down. It was only when I was walking by that I saw". 
      <br><br>
      Damage was also reported in the Desnyanski, Dniprovskyi, and Solomyaski districts.
      <br><br>
      Almost 6,000 of Kyiv's roughly 12,000 apartment buildings have been left without heating, Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram. Local energy workers had just managed to get that number below 2,000 yesterday.
      <br><br>
      "The majority of these are those we have already connected twice, or tried to connect to the heating supply after the attacks of the 9th and 20th of January," Klitschko continued.
      <br><br>
      The latest missile attack took place shortly after trilateral peace talks involving Kyiv, Moscow, and Washington.
      <br><br>
      In Kharkiv, a mass Russian attack left 27 people injured and spread destruction and fires across Ukraine's second-largest city, local authorities said.
      <br><br>
      "In total, 134 rescuers, 34 units of State Emergency Service fire and rescue service equipment, as well as police officers, medics, volunteers, and city utility services are involved in the elimination of the consequences of the Russian attack," the State Emergency Service reported.
      <br><br>
      The attacks injured a total 40 people and, in addition to energy infrastructure, damaged 60 residential buildings and 80 civilian vehicles throughout Ukraine, the Internal Affairs Ministry wrote on Jan 24.
      <br><br>
      Repeated Russian bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has left major cities without heat, electricity, or water in freezing temperatures.
      <br><br>
      The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a result of Russia's deliberate targeting of critical energy facilities infrastructure it has sought to destroy every winter since 2022. This is, however, the coldest winter since the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year, straining electrical grids and rendering the prospect of going without heating especially dire.
      <br><br>
      Klitschko has repeatedly asked Kyivans who have other places to stay to leave the city temporarily. Despite the proximity of strikes and the fact that he has electricity only about half of the time, Hennadiy, for one, says the idea is a non-starter.
      <br><br>
      "There's two million people. Where are they going to settle them? In tents somewhere? Fine, so they've gone off to some dugouts or something. What about toilets? If they can't set up electricity or anything here, then providing for two million people somewhere out there in the fields, it's just absurd," Hennadiy said.
